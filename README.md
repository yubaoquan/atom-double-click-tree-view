# double-click-tree-view package for atom editor

By default, the atom tree-view for browsing files/directories will open a file or collapse / expand
a directory listing just by single-clicking on the entry.

This package allows the user to choose single or double click on a file to open it, or on a directory to expand/collapse it. This effectively turns a single-click into just selecting the item clicked on, which is the default behavior in most editors.

Tips: if `Allow Pending Pane Items` in `Settings/Core` is set to false and `Enable on file` of this package setting is set to false, single click on file will open the file.

To install:

```apm install dbclick-tree-view```
